    <p class = "firstpara">
        The first video games started in the 1950s and 1960s, but they were just basic models, played on large computers, using oscilloscopes and used knobs and buttons to control. The first ever video game created was called ‘Tennis for Two’ and was created by the physician William Higinbotham. In this game, players used an analog computer and a controller which used knobs to angle the shot and a button to hit a dot over a line. The

game used an oscilloscope which shows electrical waves as a display screen. However, this game was never commercialised. The first video game to be fully commercial was called ‘Pong’ and was developed and published by Atari. The game used rectangular paddles that moved up and down the screen, hitting a square ball. It was controlled using knobs and a point was awarded when the opposing player failed to receive the ball. The game used simple electronic sound to accompany the ball hitting the paddle. This game became a hugely successful commercial video game. At this time, most games were played as arcade games, and the arcade industry grew modestly until the late 1970s. After the release of the classic ‘Space Invaders’ in 1978 and the release of ‘Pac-Man’ in 1980, the arcade industry boomed until 1983, when there was a decline in arcade games and the actual arcades needed to support them. There was a sudden revival in the 1990s, when the fighting game genre was created and ‘Street Fighter II' was released. However, after this and with the introduction of home consoles, arcade games have lost their relevance.
