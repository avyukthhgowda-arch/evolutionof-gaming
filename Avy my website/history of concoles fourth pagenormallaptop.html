    <p class = "firstpara">
Up until the 1970, video games were played on mainframe computers or on arcade machines and were also very simple and basic, making it hard for video games to be accessible to everyone whenever they wanted. However, in 1966 Ralph Henry Baer came up with an idea of a device that could be connected to a normal television to play video games. In 1972, Ralph sold the patent to an American electronics brand named Magnavox, where the ‘Magnavox Odyssey’ was commercialised, thus marking a start of a new era for personal video game consoles. The first handheld consoles were made in the late 1970s and early 1980s and introduced a variety of new display types, including LED, LCD and VFD. In 1977, Mattel released the first handheld video game consoles and thus led to the creation of the video games ‘Football’ and ‘Auto Race’. However, these handheld consoles could only use video games built into the console, not allowing for a large variety of games like we see today. This led to the invention of the ‘Microvision’, developed by Milton Bradley, which used LCD screens and was the first handheld console to use interchangeable cartridges, which allowed for a wider variety of games.

The history of consoles is split into 9 generations, with the first being from 1972 to 1980, second being from 1976-1992, third being from 1983-2003, fourth being from 1987-2004, fifth being from 1993-2006, sixth being from 1998-2013 seventh being from 2005-2017, eight being from 2012-present, and ninth being from 2020-present. In the first generation of consoles, games were pre-built into the console, so there were game-specific consoles. This is when the first ever games were released. In the second generation, game cartridges were introduced, which hold the game’s ROM. In this generation consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Odyssey 2 were released.

This generation was also when the first hand-held consoles were released. The third generation introduced 8-bit processors and allowed for more advanced graphics, which included the introduction of sprites and tiles. In 1983 the Nintendo Entertainment System was released, and started gaining much traction, made home consoles more popular, with the downfall of the arcade market. 16-bit processors were introduced in the fourth generation, allowing for better graphic quality and audio of games. This generation held the great ‘console wars’ between SEGA and Nintendo as Nintendo released the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and SEGA producing the SEGA Genesis, along with the character ‘Sonic The Hedgehog’ in order to rival Nintendo’s ‘Mario’. This allowed SEGA to be more dominant in North America, creating the fabled battle between SEGA and Nintendo. In the world of handheld consoles, Nintendo developed the Gameboy in 1989 which used cartridges and allowed two Gameboys to link up to play against each other. This also included the famous ‘Tetris’ game which became the Gameboy's top-selling game. In the fifth generation the console industry took a huge jump in popularity, as more people played on consoles due to the lower costs, portability, etc than that of a PC. Alongside with the jump to 32-bit processors, one major console was released – the PlayStation. PlayStation introduced the concept of memory cards, which allow you to save your game. Subsequently, PlayStation went on to be the most sold console of the fifth generation. Also, in 1995, Nintendo tried an early attempt at Virtual Reality, but however was awkward and weird, and Nintendo decided to stick with improving the Gameboy. The sixth generation saw console technology catching up with PCs, and the introduction of the DVD to support to connect the internet to be able to play online. At this point there were three major companies – Nintendo, SEGA and Sony. SEGA’s early Dreamcast quickly got beaten by the PlayStation 2 released in 2000. In this generation, Microsoft also entered the video console market with its first Xbox. Although the PlayStation 2 beat the Xbox, Microsoft saw it as a demonstration of their ability to compete in the console market. In the seventh generation, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo produced consoles capable of accessing the internet, allowing for wireless connections and online multiplayer. The Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, and PlayStation 3 was released, and the Nintendo Wii sold the most due to the use of motion controls, a new type of gaming that was completely new. PlayStation entered the handheld market with their PlayStation Portable, which used wireless connectivity to download games from the Internet. In the eighth generation, console companies focused on integration with other types of media, such as streaming services and increased connectivity. The frame rates increased to 4K resolution and the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch were released. The Nintendo Switch sold the most, due to the new approach to consoles with it being compatible with television and it being a handheld device and the ability to switch between touchscreen and joysticks.

Currently, in the ninth generation, Microsoft have released the Series X/S and Sony have released the PlayStation 5. Consoles now support in-game streaming, and now have feature that can rival advanced PCs. Nintendo have no further intention to produce any more hand-held consoles, following the release of the Nintendo Switch 2. There has also been a rise in cloud gaming, with Xbox Cloud Gaming and Amazon’s Luna, which could pose as a threat to the handheld market.    </p>
