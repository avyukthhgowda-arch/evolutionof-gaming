    <p class = "firstpara">
        There are multiple steps in the process of developing a game, in which the development process before the actual production of the game can take 6 months to 5 years, depending on the complexity of the game and other factors like resources available, the amount of people involved and many other variables. First, the pre-production stage happens, which involves the core idea of the game and planning of the game. In this stage, the planning of the game begins, which involves the target audience, the story line, the genre etc. Also in this stage, the research will take place, and this is where the GDD is made. The GDD stands for the Game Design Concept, which is, in the essence, a blueprint for the video game which includes the story, design, platform, etc. Also in this stage, the budget and team size is decided. Prototypes of the game are also created and tested. Next, the production phase happens, which is the actual building of the game. In this phase, the 3D characters and animations are built, alongside the programming of the game. Also in this phase, all the assets are integrated together in order to create the actual virtual world of the video game. The approach taken in this stage is to build, test and refine parts of the game. This is considered to be the longest part of the developing process. Finally, the last part of the process is the post-production phase. This includes marketing the game prior launch and providing updates, bug fixes and DLCs after the launch of the game. These 3 stages help to produce and successfully commercialise video games and the system is used by many game developers around the world.
